# Response to “The gamer’s dilemma” by Morgan Luck

In the paper, Luck argues that virtual murder is acceptable, intuitively, but virtual pedophilia isn’t even though the same arguments support both the cases. He tries to morally separate these two topics through various arguments. He argues that, based on a study, engaging in virtual pedophilia doesn’t increase the chances of replicating the behavior in real life any more than virtual murder does to murder. Moreover, he counters the idea that virtual pedophilia could reduce harm to children by suggesting a lack of evidence. He further discusses whether enjoying a competition which can lead to murder is different from “enjoying” virtual pedophilia, as the latter could harm the person’s character, as seen in virtue ethics. This is countered with video games where there is no competition involved but graphic killing is still rampant, such as GTA. 

Luck suggests that it is naïve to believe that gamers don’t enjoy violence, and in this view, it would be immoral to enjoy virtual murder, to any extent. He argues that while both pedophilia and murder are vile and harmful acts, the former is worse because it targets a specific group of people. However, this argument implies allowing everyone to be virtually molested, instead of just children, would be acceptable. 

Luck then argues children have a special status which makes harming a child worse than harming an adult. But he warns the reader that according to this idea we would be stating molestation is worse than murder, without any evidence. He concludes by stating that gamers may either acknowledge virtual murders and virtual pedophilia as morally permissible or both as morally prohibited. 
	
While Luck presents compelling arguments it’s hard to say that a gamer always finds murder morally better. To draw similarities, we do see pedophilia and murder in other contexts such a TV shows or movies, where we are following a storyline and engaging with the character. However, we aren’t opposed to the depiction of pedophilia or murder here. So, this makes me disagree with Luck that we always think, intuitively, murder is morally better. 

Ali’s framework for engagement is compelling as we can now let a gamer be dictated by the context and then perform a visual act. But even with this framework, we have situations where we cannot intuitively say one is better than the other. For example, he gives the story of Kratos’, an antagonist, and him molesting a child or committing murder would both fit the storyline of him being evil. So, here our intuition is not that murder is better than pedophilia as both would fit the storyline/character. 

This is however not the same in simulation, because the player would pursue what is pleasurable to them, in the absence of a preformed storyline. Hence, we need to judge the act based on the gamer’s morals. So, Ali suggests that P1 falls short because our intuitions are not the same in different types of engagements. Luck’s response to Ali acknowledges that the gamer’s dilemma doesn’t hold for all cases, but it does hold for some and that should be enough. 

As virtual gaming becomes more immersive, I would argue that we would need more in-depth psychological studies to establish its impact. For example, some studies establish in the right conditions a person can feel like their prosthetic is a real hand. Who is to say that VR games won’t have that effect? I would argue that Luck downplays the possibilities of AI and VR to easily blur boundaries between real and virtual acts. He does argue the possibility of virtual acts helping to form an outlet for players. This argument is reminiscent of establishing supervised injection sites; however, gaming isn’t supervised, and having an outlet for pedophilia suggests that the person might engage with this in real life. If we want to offer virtual pedophilia as a treatment similar to self-injection sites maybe these should be supervised by therapists or professionals along with some form of research and treatment. So, arguing that these might help as an outlet doesn’t establish why they should be accessible unsupervised. It might outweigh the possible costs to other people, and society, who don’t need such an outlet. 

While Luck makes compelling arguments, he falls short in asserting gamer’s intuition and undermines the power of VR improvements and their effects on one’s psychology. I agree that this dilemma deserves attention as we speed into enhanced gaming experiences, but I do believe that this immersive experience needs extensive research and the lack of such shouldn’t be ignored.
