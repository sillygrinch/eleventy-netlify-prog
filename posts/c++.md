## C++ or as they say C--

- In the olden days of fortran and C++, they did not know how to return mutiple values aka things. So instead they decided to pass extra parameters and then assign them to return values and "out" them. **Don't use these make tuples or pairs etc instead**
- Use std library as much as possible **they have all the nice functions you need aka map is std::transform**
- You dont need to declare variables **use auto**
- Use .h not .hpp 
- **How to compile c++?**
-- for quick compile: http://repl.it
-- for "nice" compile: use cmake 
-- o.w you need to do some ugly things that I don't want to explain
